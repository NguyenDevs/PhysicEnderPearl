This lightweight plugin adds a new level of challenge and realism to Ender Pearls by introducing bounce physics. 
Players will now need to aim more carefully—misjudging the throw might result in the pearl bouncing off and missing the intended destination.
Fully customizable to suit your server's difficulty and style.
