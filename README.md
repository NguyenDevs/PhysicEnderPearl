## PearlEnderPhysics (PEP) Plugin

**Make Ender Pearls more challenging and realistic!**  
This lightweight plugin completely changes how Ender Pearls behave by adding authentic **bounce physics**.  

No more perfect throws every time — a bad angle means your pearl will bounce off walls, floors, or even ceilings, potentially sending you somewhere completely unexpected!  
Perfect for servers that want more skill-based teleportation, PvP intensity, or just a fun touch of realism.

Fully customizable — tune the difficulty exactly to your server's style!
